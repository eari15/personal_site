<p style="color:black"> I am happily married to Fatih Erol. Fatih is a Ph.D. graduate in Political Science and International Relations, researching in political behavior and psychology, experimental analysis, and survey studies (see Fatih's site <a href="http://fatiherolphd.com">here</a>).<br></p> 

<p style="color:black">If I happen to have sparse time, I enjoy pencil drawing, sewing and violin playing.</p>
